1. random seed is a number to initialize and indicate the starting point of the PRNG,
affecting all the outputs of the PRNG. this is why using the same seed would lead to
generating the same order of numbers

2. firstly, it is not exactly fair. for example if RAND_MAX is 10 and % 3 is used, the
probabilty for each number would not exactly be equally 1/3 but different (= 0 has 4).
And if % x where x > RAND_MAX, some numbers would be omitted

3. The value of N in 'rand() % N'
